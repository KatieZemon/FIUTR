groupgd - system daemon for the Mighty Group G server

Dependencies: Boost, SQLite, systemd

To install from a tarball:

./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable groupgd.socket

If you're working from git, you need to run ./autogen.sh to generate configure.

Socket activation is required, so do not enable groupgd.service.
