groupgd - system daemon for the Mighty Group G server

Dependencies: Boost, SQLite, systemd

To install from a tarball:

./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable groupgd.socket

Some points to consider:

* Working from git? Run ./autogen.sh to generate configure.
* Reinstalled the server? Then you'd better 'sudo systemctl daemon-reload'
* Socket activation is required. Do not enable groupgd.service.
* TCP port 50000 needs to be unblocked.


=== I don't know anything! ===

I don't either, but you can:

1) Install Fedora. It has systemd.
2) sudo yum install boost-devel sqlite-devel systemd-devel
3) Follow the steps above.
4) In Fedora, you can use the firewalld GUI to open port 50000.
5) Profit.
