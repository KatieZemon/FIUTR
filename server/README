groupgd - system daemon for the Mighty Group G server

To install

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

You will need Boost and systemd.

If you're installing to a nonstandard prefix or with nonstandard $(bindir) you
will have to edit data/groupgd.service. Sorry to the 0 people whom this affects.
It does need fixed though.
